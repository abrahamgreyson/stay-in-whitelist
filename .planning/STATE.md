## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5 phases derived from 26 requirements across 5 categories
- [Roadmap]: QUAL-04 (client as instance variable) grouped with Configuration, not Code Quality, because it is an initialization/state bug closely tied to config patterns
- [Roadmap]: IDENT-06 (configurable rule prefix) grouped with Identity because it is a naming concern that enables dev/prod isolation
- [Phase 01]: Sequential fallback chain for IP detection with 4 providers, skipping providers when token missing
- [Phase 01]: tenacity 9.0.x (not 9.1+) for Python 3.9 compatibility
- [Phase 01]: get_rules returns [] on error (not None) to prevent rule accumulation -- correct contract for iteration safety
- [Phase 01]: add_rules in huawei follows same try/except pattern as delete_rules for consistency

### Pending Todos

### Blockers/Concerns
